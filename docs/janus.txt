How to set up JANUS
===================

To set up JANUS you need to do the following:

  * Set up the Mailtoken authsource (See seperate documentation)
  * Set up database
  * Configure JANUS

First thing you need to do is to set up the Mailtoken authsource. See
seperate documentation for this part. You can use other authsources to
access JANUS. Set the parameter 'useridattr' to match the attribute you want
to make the connection between the user and the entities.

Next you need to set up a database. You can use the same as you used for
Mailtoken. Complete SQL statements for MySQL is located in a separate file.

You should change the storageengine and characterset to fit your needs. You can
use another pefix for the table names, by editing the `prefix` option in the
configuration file.

Configuration file
------------------

The following is a description of the different options set in the
configuration file.

* admin.name - The name of the administrator responsible for the
installation
* admin.email - The administrators email address
* auth - The authencitacion source used
* useridattr - The attribute used as refrence to entities
* store - Database configuration
   - dsn - Database source name
   - username - The username used to connect to the database
   - password - The password used to connect to the database
   - prefix - The table prefix used
* workflowstates - Definition of available states
* workflowstate.default - The default state a new entity will be created
with
* metadatafields.TYPE - A list of metadata fields that can be created for an
entity of a given TYPE
* required.metadatafields.TYPE - Metadata fields that are required to export
metadata
* usertypes - The usertypes defined for the current installation. The admin
type should not be removed.
* access - A matrix defining access permissions different elements in the
user interface
* workflow_states - Definition of state transitions between the states
defined in 'workflowstates'

Defining access permissions
---------------------------

In JANUS a number of different elements are defined that you can control
access to. A complete list can be seen in the configuration file. The access
definitions are done using arrays. The syntax is as following:

    'ELEMENT' => array(
	    'default' => BOOLEANVALUE,
		'STATE' => array(
		    'role' => array(
			    'USERTYPE',
		    ),						 
		),						  
		'STATE' => array(
		    'role' => array(
			    'USERTYPE',
		    ),						 
		),	
        ...
	),

Allowed values for STATE is the states defined in the 'workflowstates'
option. The allowed values for USERTYPE is the usertypes defined in the
'usertypes' option and the value 'all'. Furthermore you can negate the
values by prefixing the value with a '-'.
If the element do not relate to a state, the 'role' parameter should replace
the STATE parameter. By setting the dafault parameter, you will control
access to all states you have not defined access for.
you can define multible instances of the STATE parameter, for fine grained
access control.

Defining workflows
------------------

JANUS uses workflow to control the evolution ofan entity. The differet
states an entiy can be in is defined by the option 'workflowstates' in the
configuration file. The syntax is as following:

    'STATEKEY' => array(
        'name' => 'STATENAME'						 
    ),

The statekey is userdefined and is only used as an internal key. The
STATENAME is a human readable name for the state si is the information
presented to the users.

The state transitions is defined in the option 'workflow_states'. The syntax
for defining state transitions is as following:

    'STARTSTATE' => array(
	    'ENDSTATE' => array(
		    'role' => array(
			    'USERTYPE',				
			),					   
		),				
	  	'ENDSTATE' => array(
			'role' => array(
				'USERTYPE',				
			),						 
		),
        ...
	),

You can define multiple endstates to allow for different workflows.
Usertypes uses the same syntax as for access permissions.
