      # Is the working copy clean?
      - working-copy-check

    # How should the next version be determined?
    # Since this only counts for non official release (for example to deploy to a test environment)
    # The rules are a little different, The version is created by a custom version persister
    # which actually 'tricks' RMT. It does not generate simple version but returns the current commit
    # hash as version
