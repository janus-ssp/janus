UPGRADE NOTES FOR JANUS

v. 1.12 to v.1.13
This query adds a column to store attribute manipulations in the JANUS database.

    ALTER TABLE `janus__entity` ADD COLUMN `manipulation` MEDIUMTEXT NULL DEFAULT NULL  AFTER `arp` ;

v. 1.11 to v.1.12
Blacklisting / Whitelisting has switched from whitelisting EntityIds (which can change)
to JANUS internal Eids (which can't change).
To migrate please FIRST run the following SQL on your database:

    ALTER TABLE `janus__allowedEntity` ADD `remoteeid` INT( 11 ) NOT NULL AFTER `remoteentityid` ,
        ADD INDEX ( `remoteeid` );
    ALTER TABLE `janus__blockedEntity` ADD `remoteeid` INT( 11 ) NOT NULL AFTER `remoteentityid` ,
        ADD INDEX ( `remoteeid` );

THEN run the following script:

    php docs/upgrade-allowed-blocked-connections.php


v. 1.10 to v.1.11
The old exportentities and the aggregator have been retired and replaced with a
new metadata exporter. The old aggregator have not been removed for backwards
compability issues, but the configuration options have been removed from  the
config template. You need to copy the appropriate options yourself n order for
the old aggregator to work. A description and configuation options for the new
metadata exporter, can be found in the documantation wiki at
http://code.google.com/p/janus-ssp/wiki/MetadataExport

The `order` option in metadatafields are no longer used and all metadatafields
are now sorted in a natual case-insensitive way. You do not need to remove the
option, but JANUS no longer reads the option, when sorting metadatafields.

You now have the ability to disable entities for administrators (see the
'Admin' tab and the 'Connections' sub-tab). You MUST apply the following SQL to
 your database:

    ALTER TABLE janus__entity ADD active ENUM('yes', 'no') NOT NULL DEFAULT 'yes';

JANUS version 1.11 allows certain attributes in Attribute Release Policies to
specify only specific values that are allowed. For instance an IdP may only
specify that a user has an eduPersonEntitlement of 
'urn:mace:washington.edu:confocalMicroscope', excluding other values like
'urn:mace:washington.edu:telescope'. In order to do this the datastructure has
changed. To change to the new structure, simply edit and save every ARP, or run
the following script:

    php docs/upgrade-arps.php

from the JANUS root.

Note also that the default behaviour of deleting an ARP has changed, deleting
an ARP switches all entities that have that ARP to not have an ARP.

You also need to execute the following SQL on your database:

    ALTER TABLE janus__arp ADD COLUMN is_default BOOLEAN AFTER attributes;

v. 1.9 to v. 1.10
JANUS version 1.10.0 introduces validation of certificates of metadata and endpoints,
in order to do this it needs to be told which CAs to trust, by default JANUS looks in the
following file: '/etc/pki/tls/certs/ca-bundle.crt' (Mozillas list of trusted CAs,
from the ca-certificates package).
If you do not have this file you can set the 'ca_bundle_file' setting.
Also you will need to add the following in your Access configuration
(in config/module_janus.php under the 'access' key) to use the new validation:
        // Validate metadata
        'validatemetadata' => array(
            'default' => TRUE,
        ),

This version also enhances metadata refreshing and introduces periodic validation
of entities and their endpoints (Binding Locations).

The config 'cron', if present, should be renamed to 'metadata_refresh_cron_tags'.
If you want to use validation of entities and their endpoints you can use the
'validate_entity_certificate_cron_tags' and 'validate_entity_endpoints_cron_tags'
settings (see config-templates/module_janus.php for their use).

Also you need to execute the following SQL on your database:

    ALTER TABLE `janus__arp` ADD `deleted` char(25) NOT NULL AFTER `updated`;

    ALTER TABLE `janus__entity`
        ADD `metadata_valid_until` DATETIME NULL AFTER `metadataurl` ,
        ADD `metadata_cache_until` DATETIME NULL AFTER `metadata_valid_until`;

If you were using the REST interface, you will also need to update your workflow states
configuration with the 'isDeployable' flag.
The REST interface will ONLY return information about entities that have this flag set to true.

v. 1.8 to v. 1.9
JANUS version 1.9.0 introduces several new access control points in order to
make access control more fine grained. The following access control points have
been added:
 - adminusertab - Gives access to the admin tab
 - experimental - Give access to experimental features
 - editsubscriptions - Giv access to the subscriptions tab under the inbox tab
 - addsubscriptions - Give access to add subscriptions
 - deletesubscriptions - Give access to delete of subscriptions

You should add these access control options to your configuration file in order
to make sure your updated JANUS installation will run smoothly.

The description field on the metadata field configuration has been moved to a
dictionary file. So if you are using custom metadata fileds, you should add the
descriptions to the metadatafield.definition.jsonm and
metadatafield.translation.json files.

The use of the supported option on metadata fields have changed. You now need
to put an # in the metadata field name. The # will then be substituted with the
values, you are giving in the supported option.

v. 1.7 to v. 1.8
JANUS now requires SSP v. 1.7.0 or higher to work. If you are upgrading an
exsisting installation remember to upgrade SSP as well.

Several standard metadata field have changed:
 - contacts:X:name have been removed. Please change and split to
   contacts:X:GivenName and contacts:X:SurName
 - organization:name:XX has changed to OrganizationName:XX
 - organization:description:XX has changed to OrganizationDisplayName:XX
 - organization:url:XX has changed to OrganizationURL:XX

Note that the old style names are not recognized anymore and are not exported
to XML metadata. They are still exported to SSP flatfile format.

The standard SQL dump have been updated so all tables are now using UTF-8 as
charset. This should not have any impact on exsisting installations.

The configuration of allowed attributes in the configuration file has been
simplified. Attributes are now a simple array of attribute names. You must
change this configuration option, in order to use APR's in JANUS v. 1.8.x after
an upgrade.

The types for bindings in the configuration file has changed to select type. If
you are using non-standard binding values, then you should upgrade the metadata
field in the configuration file.

The Mailtoken auth source have been removed from JANUS. To continue using the
Mailtoken auth source, please download it seperatly from
https://code.google.com/p/mailtoken/

If you encounter any other problems while upgrading other than the issues
stated in this document, please create an issue on the JANUS bug tracker at
https://code.google.com/p/janus-ssp/issues/list

v. 1.5 to v. 1.6
You can use the upgrade.php script located in the www/util/ folder to do the DA
updates. NOTE the upgrade script do not upgrade your config file.
 - Update entity tabel: 
    ALTER TABLE `janus__entity` ADD `user` INT NOT NULL AFTER `arp`   
 - Rename alle metadata fields containing entity:name:da, entity:name:en etc.
    UPDATE `janus__metadata` 
    SET `key` = 'name:en' 
    WHERE `key` =  'entity:name:en';
 - Rename alle metadata fields containing entity:desription:da, entity:description:en etc.
    UPDATE `janus__metadata` 
    SET `key` = 'description:en' 
    WHERE `key` =  'entity:description:en';
 - Rename alle metadata fields containing contacts:contactType to
   contacts:0:contactType. Do the same for the rest of the contact fields: name, surName, givenName, telephoneNumber, emailAddress, company
    UPDATE `janus__metadata` 
    SET `key` = 'contacts:0:contactType' 
    WHERE `key` =  'contacts:contactType';
 - Rename endpoint metadata
    
    UPDATE `janus__metadata`
    SET `key` = 'certFingerprint:0'
    WHERE `key` = 'certFingerprint';

    UPDATE `janus__metadata`
    SET `key` = 'SingleSignOnService:0:Location'
    WHERE `key` = 'SingleSignOnService';

    UPDATE `janus__metadata`
    SET `key` = 'SingleLogoutService:0:Location'
    WHERE `key` = 'SingleLogoutService';

    UPDATE `janus__metadata`
    SET `key` = 'AssertionConsumerService:0:Location'
    WHERE `key` = 'AssertionConsumerService';

 - REMEMBER to add the SingleSignOnService:0:Binding,
   SingleLogoutService:o:Binding and AssertionConsumerService:0:Binding to the 
   config file and all entities. Otherwise SSP will not export metadata. 

    INSERT INTO janus__metadata (eid, revisionid, `key`, value, created, ip)
    SELECT distinct jm.eid, jm.revisionid,
    'SingleSignOnService:0:Binding' as 'key',
    'urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Redirect' as 'value',
    '2010-08-18T13:00:00+02:00' as 'created',
    '127.0.0.1' as 'ip'
    FROM  `janus__metadata` jm
    WHERE `jm`.`key` = 'SingleSignOnService:0:Location'
    AND NOT EXISTS
    (SELECT * FROM janus__metadata jms WHERE `jms`.`key` =
    'SingleSignOnService:0:Binding' AND jms.eid = jm.eid AND jms.revisionid = jm.revisionid);

    INSERT INTO janus__metadata (eid, revisionid, `key`, value, created, ip)
    SELECT distinct jm.eid, jm.revisionid,
    'SingleLogoutService:0:Binding' as 'key',
    'urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-Redirect' as 'value',
    '2010-08-18T13:00:00+02:00' as 'created',
    '127.0.0.1' as 'ip'
    FROM  `janus__metadata` jm
    WHERE `jm`.`key` = 'SingleLogoutService:0:Location'
    AND NOT EXISTS
    (SELECT * FROM janus__metadata jms WHERE `jms`.`key` =
    'SingleLogoutService:0:Binding' AND jms.eid = jm.eid AND jms.revisionid = jm.revisionid);

    INSERT INTO janus__metadata (eid, revisionid, `key`, value, created, ip)
    SELECT distinct jm.eid, jm.revisionid,
    'AssertionConsumerService:0:Binding' as 'key',
    'urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:bindings:HTTP-POST' as 'value',

    AND NOT EXISTS
    (SELECT * FROM janus__metadata jms WHERE `jms`.`key` =
    'AssertionConsumerService:0:Binding' AND jms.eid = jm.eid AND jms.revisionid = jm.revisionid);

 - Attributes for the ARP editor is not given in the 'attributes' key in the
   config file. This obsoletes the old 'attributes.saml20-sp',
   'attributes.saml20-idp', 'attributes.shib13-sp' and 'attributes.shib13-idp'

 - Add entity.prettyname to be able to list all entities with a pretty name
   instead of the entityID.

 - Rebember to cross check your existing config file to the config template, to
   make sure your config file is up to date.
