            * r1176 Continued generous sprinkle of htmlspecialchars to harden against XSS attacks

            https://github.com/janus-ssp/janus/tree/v.1.11.6
                * r1170 Security: Always use the userid - ie. the email address used to login with - to send mails as opposed to the unchecked emailaddress. This is done to prevent the posibility of using Janus for phishing. The patch changes User->getEmail so it returns the userid. Removed the <input> of unchecked email in dashboard template. Removed the setEmail in dashboard script.

      05/04/2013 1.11.5 from branches/v.1.11
                * r1165 Removed refURL and added $_GET as parameters before redirecting to janus/index.php in dashboard.php and editentity.php. Solves the problem that mailtokens issued to pages other than index.php did not get passed to index.php where they are actually checked.'

      05/04/2013 1.11.4 from branches/v.1.11
            https://github.com/janus-ssp/janus/tree/v.1.11.4

                This release contains important security fixes to harden Janus against XSS attacks and continues the effort to implement access control

                * r1147 Do not allow the user to set userid or usertype - use session userid and default usertype
                * r1148 Quick fix to allow only <a> and <br> in message data from getMessage to prevent XSS attacks. The message is formatted on posting and it would probably be better to do encode htmlspecialchars there.
                * r1149 Added authentication source to logouturl - so logout actually logs the user out
                * r1150 Generous sprinkle of htmlspecialchars to harden against XSS attacks
